# weatherApp
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- This project was to demonstrate the use of the open weather api.
- What problem does it solve?
- this allows for users to search by city, and get weather data
- What did you learn?
- I learned that some apis require developers to have a key in order to us the api. I also got some practice using the function fetch().

## Usage

Users can search for city in the searchbar
![weather1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85265225/123758698-0b296400-d874-11eb-965c-10d714203df5.png)
![weather2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85265225/123758701-0bc1fa80-d874-11eb-9571-2c88d6879d42.png)
Weather details will be displayed
![weather3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85265225/123761169-69efdd00-d876-11eb-9aed-23b1c3f49182.png)



New city searches will populate new buttons. There are meant to display previous weather data, but that seem to be broken.
